# Restaurant Dining Reservation Web Application

As required in your Fundamentals of Software Engineering class (COSC 4351), you are to design a dining reservation web application. Hence, the creation of this repository. This project consists of three individuals. We'll be using Next JS for our front-end and MongoDB (or Firebase) as our query language.
