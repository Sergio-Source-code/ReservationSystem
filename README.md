# Restaurant Dining Reservation Web Application

As required in your Fundamentals of Software Engineering class (COSC 4351), you are to design a dining reservation web application. Hence, the creation of this repository. This project consists of three individuals. We'll be using Next JS for our front-end and MongoDB (or Firebase) as our query language. 

## Cloning the Repository:

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `pages/index.js`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

[API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) can be accessed on [http://localhost:3000/api/hello](http://localhost:3000/api/hello). This endpoint can be edited in `pages/api/hello.js`.

The `pages/api` directory is mapped to `/api/*`. Files in this directory are treated as [API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) instead of React pages.

## What is the purpose of each file in this Next JS project?:
