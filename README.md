# Restaurant Dining Reservation Web Application

As required in your Fundamentals of Software Engineering class (COSC 4351), you are to design a dining reservation web application. Hence, the creation of this repository. This project consists of three individuals. We'll be using Next JS for our front-end and MongoDB (or Firebase) as our query language. 

## Cloning the Repository:

Cloning the repository is how you take the contents of the code here and place it in your Visual Studio Editor. To do so, start visual studios. Then, on the left hand side, click *Clone Git Repository*:

Then go to the page of the Github repository that you wish to collaborate with (in this case we use this [repository](https://github.com/Sergio-Source-code/ReservationSystem/)). After going to that repository site, click on the following button that says `code`:

Then copy the contents under the tab `HTTPS` of the element that pops up:

## What is the purpose of each file in this Next JS project?:

Here, we have the following file structure:
```
📁 components
📁 pages
📁 public
📁 styles
📜 .eslintrc.json
📜 .next.config.js
📜 package.json
📜 .gitinore
📜 package-lock.json
```

We only have to worry about the folders:

## Pushing Code to the Repository:

For this project, we have opted **not** to use branching. This could create issues, and has a high development risk for unsynchronized projects. However, since we have a small teams, we would emphasize that individuals `pull` before `push`.
